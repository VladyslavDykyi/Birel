		Forge Global, Inc. and its affiliated companies (“Forge”, us, we, etc.) collectively publish and operate a
		software platform, marketplace, and service (together, the “Platform”), to facilitate transactions in secondary
		markets (the “Transactions”) of and relating to shares of private companies (the “Shares”). The Platform is
		available on the website forgeglobal.com and via Forge mobile application (collectively, the “Site”).
		<br><br>
		These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding agreement between Forge on the one hand, and the individual
		(“you”) who accesses, browses, or in any way uses the Platform, the Site, any other related application, any
		services thereon, or other related services offered by Forge (all together, Forge’s “Services”).
		<br><br>
		By visiting the Site, using the Services, signing an agreement that incorporates these Terms, registering as a
		“Site Member” (as described below), or otherwise indicating or manifesting your assent, you acknowledge that you
		have read, understood, agreed to enter into, and will abide by these Terms, Forge’s Privacy Policy as described
		below, and all notices, rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish on the Site.
		<br><br>
		If you use the Services as an approved proxy for another individual (e.g. your work supervisor or a client)
		and/or on behalf of one or more business entities you, or they own, manage, or advise (such as funds or holding
		companies), then you agree to these Terms on your own behalf and on behalf of those individuals and entities (to
		which references to “you” also apply), and may only use the Services if you have the authority from each such
		individual and entity to do so. If you setup multiple accounts, or multiple entity listings within an account,
		you are making a separate agreement between each of them and Forge.
		<br><br>
		If at any time you do not agree with these Terms or the Privacy Policy, do not use or continue to use the Site
		or the Services.

		Description of Transactions
	</h2>
	<p class="t-r f18-l32 purple2">
		Forge facilitates Transactions between (i) “Shareholders”, who own Shares, either directly or by virtue of
		holding instruments relating to shares such as options, futures contracts, or interests in holding companies
		that own Shares, and (ii) “Investors” who contemplate gaining investment exposure to Shares. You may access the
		Site as a Shareholder, an Investor, or both. If you are not a Shareholder or potential Investor, but wish to
		examine the Platform as a student, researcher, scholar, analyst, journalist, auditor, investigator, private
		equity broker, as an advisor to Shareholders and Investors, or in some other role, your access to certain Site
		and Service functionality will be limited or blocked, including among other things the ability to place
		Transaction requests or close Transactions.
		<br><br>
		Transactions may be initiated through the Site, or off-site by email, telephone, or other means, but in any case
		under the auspices of duly licensed broker-dealers affiliated with Forge (the “Brokers”). One a Transaction is
		pending, the Broker will circulate an electronic link to a closing service (the “Closing Platform”) that, among
		other things, contains agreements appropriate to memorialize any transaction terms, including any provisions
		regarding commissions, nondisclosure of confidential information, non-circumvention, and other terms,
		conditions, notices, and disclosures that are customary to govern the Transaction (the “Transaction Documents”).
		<br><br>
		The Closing Platform is part of the Site, and your use of the Closing Platform and associated Services is
		conditioned on your accepting these Terms. On your request, as an alternative to the Closing Platform, we may
		circulate documents by email, third party electronic signature service, or paper documents.
